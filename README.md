# Jupyter-Project

This project is intended to serve as a guide for notebook tools (Jupyter, Azure as well as Binder). 

## Components

This repository contains three main sections: <a href="https://github.com/kinges17/Jupyter-Project/tree/master/Generic-Project">a generic project</a>, some references for <a href="https://github.com/kinges17/Jupyter-Project/tree/master/Getting-Started">getting started</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kinges17/Jupyter-Project/tree/master/Demos">links to demo notebooks</a>.

### The Generic Project

This directory contains a skeleton project (a README and a Notebooks directory containing a Project.ipynb) ready for adapting to your needs.

### Getting Started

If you are new to notebooks or to programming, this directory contains several introductory courses for the following:

<ul>
    <li>Introduction to Python</li>
    <li>Introduction to R</li>
    <li>And introductions to Jupyter Notebook, Azure Notebook as well as Binder</li>
</ul>

### Demos

Please refer to this section if you are already comfortable with notebooks and basic programming concepts, or if you are simply curious as to what data exploration in a notebook looks like. This section contains end-use organized notebooks to serve as examples. Use cases include (but are not limited to) the following:

<ul>
    <li>Social Data: An analysis of responses to a Github survey</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence: Predicting a five star review of a restaurant</li>
    <li>Biology: Psychophysical data modeling</li>
    <li>Text Mining: Mining the social web</li>
    <li>Improving Representations: How to best use visualizations in notebooks</li>
    <li>... and more</li>
</ul>
