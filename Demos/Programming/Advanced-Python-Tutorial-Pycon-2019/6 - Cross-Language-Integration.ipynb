Though they **also** work on pure terminal IPython, nbconvert or any other programmatic use of IPython.\n",

I just show how seamless a cross language environment can be from the user point of view. The installation of these library might not be easy either and getting all these language to play together can be complex task. It is though becoming easier and easier.\n",
