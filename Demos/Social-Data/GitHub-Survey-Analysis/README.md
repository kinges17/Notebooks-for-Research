# Python II: Github Survey Data Analysis

To use the OpenSourceSurvey notebook, please make sure to have the following installed: pandas (including pandas.api.types and pandas.plotting), numpy, matplotlib (including matplotlib.pyplot), mpl_toolkits.mplot3d, datetime and collections.

When first running the notebook, please allow some time for execution data cleaning and refinement. As these steps must touch all cells in the dataframe, they take several minutes to complete. I recommend selecting the "Restart & Run All" Kernel option and then going to make a cup of coffee. The kernel will be finished by the time you return.

To view the data and other data-relevant details, please view the data directory. To view the PDF version of the notebook, please view the report directory. Lastly, to interact with the notebook please navigate to OpenSourceSurvey.ipynb in the code directory.
